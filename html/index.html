        <p>Our sires' age was worse that our grandsires'. We their sons are more worthless than they: so in our turn we shall
            give the world a progeny yet more corrupt. -- Quintus Horatius Flaccus (Horace)</p>

            If he once again pushes up his sleeves in order to compute for 3 days and 3 nights in a row, he will spend a quarter of an
            hour before to think which principles of computation shall be most appropriate. -- Voltaire, "Diatribe du docteur
            Akakia"

            The justifications for drug testing are part of the presently fashionable debate concerning restoring America's "competitiveness."
            Drugs, it has been revealed, are responsible for rampant absenteeism, reduced output, and poor quality work.
            But is drug testing in fact rationally related to the resurrection of competitiveness? Will charging the atmosphere
            of the workplace with the fear of excretory betrayal honestly spur productivity? Much noise has been made about
            rehabilitating the worker using drugs, but to date the vast majority of programs end with the simple firing or
            the not hiring of the abuser. This practice may exacerbate, not alleviate, the nation's productivity problem.
            If economic rehabilitation is the ultimate goal of drug testing, then criteria abandoning the rehabilitation
            of the drug-using worker is the purest of hypocrisy and the worst of rationalization. -- The concluding paragraph
            of "Constitutional Law: The Fourth Amendment and Drug Testing in the Workplace," Tim Moore, Harvard Journal of
            Law &amp; Public Policy, vol. 10, No. 3 (Summer 1987), pp. 762-768.
