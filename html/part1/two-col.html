        <p id="p1">Vim adds automatic indentation for many filetypes; by default, you're not allowed to backspace over this; the rules of what is considered to be 'autoindentation' are somewhat subtle, for example, if we would type this (where â–ˆ is the cursor):</p>
        <p id="p2">This is because in the first example, Vim determined it should add 1 level of indentation when you pressed Enter; but in the second example, Vim didn't autoindent anything, it's just Tab characters or a few spaces.</p>
